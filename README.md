# SolastaExtendCharacterNames
This is about the simplest mod possible, and allows you to use some letters that TA currently blocks you from using in your character's first and last names.
For example the apostrophe '.
Now you can call your Ranger "Wizzt Bo'nerden" if you so wish.  Not wanting to break copyright, see what I did there :)
I give no guarantee that TA aren't right in blocking those letters (aka glyphs), so caveat emptor and all that.
Also as an added bonus I trim trailing spaces from the names.
